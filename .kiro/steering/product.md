# Product Overview

Tozin Solutions is a Spring Boot-based backend application that appears to be an e-commerce or furniture management system. The application handles product management (specifically sofas based on the uploads directory), user authentication with JWT tokens, file uploads, and email notifications.

## Key Features
- Product catalog management (furniture/sofas)
- User authentication and authorization with JWT
- File upload and static resource serving
- Email notifications via SMTP
- Message queuing with RabbitMQ
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation

## Architecture Approach
The project follows a versioned API approach with both V1 and V2 implementations, suggesting an evolution from traditional layered architecture (V1) to a more domain-driven design approach (V2).
